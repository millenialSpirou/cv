\section*{Education}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mcgill Bsc. Mathematics major \\
    2012--2018

\section*{Work Experience}

\begin{itemize}
        \item ADOPT/IBS:\@ Senior Product Engineer\\ May 2021 (current occupation)

                This company develops a software solution to generate optimal
                schedules for aircraft operating companies.  I was a member of
                the "core" team which is responsible for the development of the
                nucleus of algorithms (column generation based) which drive the
                main product. A migration towards more modern web technologies
                was in effect when I joined. As such we also needed to
                implement REST apis and start worrying about network related
                challenges (e.g. authentification/authorization, latency)
                as well as some associated with distributed systems since the
                architecture relied on deploying containers in a k8s
                environment (coherence of state, collection of logs,
                impossibility of relying on persistent local state etc.)

                At first I mostly worked on helping the rest api
                implementation (python flask) and adding functionality in the
                data management engine (scheme r5rs). A year later, after some
                administrative reshuffling, I ended up being in charge of the
                backend.

                My tasks consisted of:
                \begin{itemize}
                        \item Deployment and configuration of keycloak + postgresql for user management.
                        \item Design and implementation of a distributed message-queue network using rabbitmq to handle generation of reports and statistics asynchronously as well as SSE notifications
                        \item Creation of an extremely simple policy mechanism relying on policies encoded in json matched with http methods, requested urls and their parameters
                        \item Deployment and configuration of a log aggregation pipeline: syslog-ng in containers targetting a loki database with a grafana frontend
                        \item Take charge of frontend codebase (it was in administrative limbo and tickets were not being processed) in order to test and present improvements to management.
                        \item Supervision of two interns assigned to frontend tasks
                \end{itemize}

                I never had the time to work on the operations research
                concerns I was hired for originally.

distributed data challenges, compiler technologies, languages with different
paradigms; lisps, FP (ML family), concurrency focused ones (Go, Erlang), logic
programming (Prolog,minikanren)
\section*{Skills}
My undergrad was completed in applied mathematics at McGill university
with a minor in computer science. While my first two years were focused
on pure math prerequisites I had the chance to narrow down my studies on
mathematical optimization in my last year. My final project was a literature
review on non smooth optimization methods in the case of difference of convex
functions.\\

I am currently in the process of finishing up my masters in Artificial
Intelligence at UdeM at the Departement d'informatique et de Recherche
Operationelle (DIRO). In my first year I took courses in structured learning and
probability theory. Now in my second year I am focusing on deep learning.\\

In the context of my studies I have implemented various machine learning
algorithms in Python. Examples include LSTM for text generation, GMM inference
and struct-SVM methods based on projections and Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe;
amongst others.\\

In terms of data structures my education has been mostly in C++.  My skills in
Cpp date back to my two years in Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique where
it was the language used to teach basic programming. I used it again at McGill
where I took a courses in discrete methods and algorithm design.\\

The two programming languages I consider to be fluent in are python and cpp however
I have studied a fair bit of programming language theory on my own which has meant
learning bits of Scheme, Common Lisp, OCaml and Haskell.\\

I am a native French speaker but have also been speaking writing and reading English for most
of my life. I have been trying to learn Portuguese (BR) for a couple of years on my own.\\
