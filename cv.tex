\section*{Skills}
My undergrad was completed in applied mathematics at McGill university
with a minor in computer science. While my first two years were focused
on pure math prerequisites I had the chance to narrow down my studies on
mathematical optimization in my last year. My final project was a literature
review on non smooth optimization methods in the case of difference of convex
functions.\\

I am currently in the process of finishing up my masters in Artificial
Intelligence at UdeM at the Departement d'informatique et de Recherche
Operationelle (DIRO). In my first year I took courses in structured learning and
probability theory. Now in my second year I am focusing on deep learning.\\

In the context of my studies I have implemented various machine learning
algorithms in Python. Examples include LSTM for text generation, GMM inference
and struct-SVM methods based on projections and Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe;
amongst others.\\

In terms of data structures my education has been mostly in C++.  My skills in
Cpp date back to my two years in Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique where
it was the language used to teach basic programming. I used it again at McGill
where I took a courses in discrete methods and algorithm design.\\

The two programming languages I consider to be fluent in are python and cpp however
I have studied a fair bit of programming language theory on my own which has meant
learning bits of Scheme, Common Lisp, OCaml and Haskell.\\

I am a native French speaker but have also been speaking writing and reading English for most
of my life. I have been trying to learn Portuguese (BR) for a couple of years on my own.\\
