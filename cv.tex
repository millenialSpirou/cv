\section*{Work Experience}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ADOPT/IBS:\@ Senior Product Engineer, member of "Core" team (infrastructure, backend, optimization)\\ 2021 (current job)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Improve and develop new features for the backend written in Scheme (R5RS) and an associated reactive object engine
        (incremental computation). This backend is mostly a layer for data consistency management that wraps around the companies' solvers.
      \item Implement new functionalities pertaining to relationships between objects
        and update propagation between them in above mentionned data model (incremental computation)
      \item Upgrade, maintain and develop new REST functionalities (Python and Flask)
      \item Implement new suite of unittests (pytest)
      \item Push new releases through custom pipeline 
        (sh and Perl scripts, Makefiles, Docker, K8s + Helm)
      \item Maintain infrastructure in clusters both on local hardware (VMware) and remote (gcloud)
    \end{itemize}

  \item GIRO:\@ C++ developer for transport scheduling module team \\ 2017 (7 months)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Develop new features for transport visualization
      \item Update codebase to new standards (e.g. C++14 and STL)
      \item Implement database migration tool (essentially symmetric serializers and deserializers)
      \item Maintain legacy C++98
    \end{itemize}

\clearpage

  \item Ubisoft:\@ data science intern for the User Research Lab\\ 2016 (5 months)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Write SQL (HiveQL) queries to present quantitative data to developer team
      \item Produce dashboards for the developer teams and management teams
      \item Address efficiency issues in big data environment (order of petabytes)
      \item Maintain the ETL pipeline (airflow), which includes monitoring
        the temporary tables in the associated directed acyclic graph and debugging failed queries.
    \end{itemize}

  \item Resarch Institute McGill University Health Center:\@ research assistant\\ 2015 (1.5 year, part-time)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Implement statistical analysis tools relevant to given data in R
      \item Implement tool for automated periodic reporting of key metrics
      \item Evaluate and recommend modifications concerning the data logging
        interface for clinicians and its impact on data analysis quality
    \end{itemize}

  \item Santropol Roulant:\@ bike coop program manager\\ 2014 (4 months internship)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Migrate ad-hoc sales system to point of sale system (POS) and computerized inventory management
      \item Organize workshops in bike repair
      \item Repair and maintain coop's bike fleet
      \item Schedule and manage monthly meetings of the volunteer team

\section*{Skills}
My undergrad was completed in applied mathematics at McGill university
with a minor in computer science. While my first two years were focused
on pure math prerequisites I had the chance to narrow down my studies on
mathematical optimization in my last year. My final project was a literature
review on non smooth optimization methods in the case of difference of convex
functions.\\

I am currently in the process of finishing up my masters in Artificial
Intelligence at UdeM at the Departement d'informatique et de Recherche
Operationelle (DIRO). In my first year I took courses in structured learning and
probability theory. Now in my second year I am focusing on deep learning.\\

In the context of my studies I have implemented various machine learning
algorithms in Python. Examples include LSTM for text generation, GMM inference
and struct-SVM methods based on projections and Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe;
amongst others.\\

In terms of data structures my education has been mostly in C++.  My skills in
Cpp date back to my two years in Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique where
it was the language used to teach basic programming. I used it again at McGill
where I took a courses in discrete methods and algorithm design.\\

The two programming languages I consider to be fluent in are python and cpp however
I have studied a fair bit of programming language theory on my own which has meant
learning bits of Scheme, Common Lisp, OCaml and Haskell.\\

I am a native French speaker but have also been speaking writing and reading English for most
of my life. I have been trying to learn Portuguese (BR) for a couple of years on my own.\\
